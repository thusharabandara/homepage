# Thushara R. Bandara's Homepage

Welcome to my homepage! 

This website has been created to showcase my scholarly works, activities contributed throughout my career, and teaching experience to date.

As an academic and researcher, I believe in the power of sharing knowledge and experiences. That is why I decided to create this site to make my work and experiences more accessible to others who may find it useful or interesting.

On this site, you will find information about my research work, activities, and teaching experience. You can browse through different sections of the website using the navigation bar, which includes links to each of the sections. It also includes smooth scrolling animation, making the navigation experience more pleasant.

I hope this homepage provides you with valuable insights into my professional career, and please feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or would like to collaborate on any projects.
